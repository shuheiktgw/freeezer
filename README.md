# freeezer

fre"e"ezer is a gem which provides a `deep_freeze` method for Hash and Array object. 


## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

```ruby
gem 'freeezer'
```

And then execute:

    $ bundle

Or install it yourself as:

    $ gem install freeezer

## Usage
All you need to do is just to call `using Freeezer` and you can use `deep_freeeze` method for Hash and Array object.

```ruby
using Freeezer
  
HASH_CONST = { first: 'one', second: 'two' }.deep_freeze
HASH_CONST.all?{|_key, value| value.frozen? } # => true

ARRAY_CONST = ['first', 'second', 'third'].deep_freeze
ARRAY_CONST.all?{|value| value.frozen? } # => true
```

Of course you can call `using Freeezer` inside a class.

```ruby
class TestClass
  using Freeezer
  
  HASH_CONST = { first: 'one', second: 'two' }.deep_freeze
  ARRAY_CONST = ['first', 'second', 'third'].deep_freeze
end

TestClass::HASH_CONST.all?{|_key, value| value.frozen? } # => true
TestClass::ARRAY_CONST.all?{|value| value.frozen? } # => true
```

Also, it will freeze Hash, or Array even if it is nested. Please be aware that the name is not `freezer` but `freeezer`.
